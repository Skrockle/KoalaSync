# KoalaSync Changelog

All notable changes to the KoalaSync browser extension and relay server.

---

## [v2.1.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- Added full translation support for 7 new languages to both the browser extension popup settings and landing website: Italian (`it`), Polish (`pl`), Turkish (`tr`), Dutch (`nl`), Japanese (`ja`), Korean (`ko`), and European Portuguese (`pt`).
- Implemented robust, centralized browser system language detection mapping `pt-BR` to Brazilian Portuguese and other `pt` locales (like `pt-PT`) automatically to European Portuguese.
- Added flag emojis to language selector dropdowns in both the extension popup and landing/utility web pages for quicker visual identification.
- Added 181 translation keys parity validation suite checks for the new languages.

### Fixed & Hardened (Extension Audit)
- Guarded all website `localStorage` interactions to prevent initialization/join flow script failures on privacy-hardened or cookie-blocked browser configurations.
- Added robust validation null-guards to `chrome.runtime.onMessage` listeners across all extension scripts (`bridge.js`, `content.js`, `background.js`, `popup.js`) to reject unexpected runtime messages.
- Guarded CustomEvent payload destructuring in `bridge.js` to ensure stability when receiving third-party page events.
- Wrapped `video.currentTime` seeking adjustments during forced sync in content scripts with exception handling to absorb uninitialized video state DOMExceptions.
- Added payload validation guards on incoming Socket.IO events within the background script's event handlers to secure against malformed server updates.
- Prevented noisy browser console exceptions from context invalidation in target tabs by catching promise rejections on extension message dispatches.

### Performance
- Implemented in-memory language dictionary caching in the background script to completely avoid redundant extension package filesystem reads during translations.

## [v2.0.8] — 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- Fixed a bug where switching language inside the extension popup overwrote dynamic fields (such as active room ID, connection status, active server details, and video debug info) with default localized placeholder texts.
- Fixed a version reporting mismatch where the copied logs (debug reports) and connection handshake parameters incorrectly reported the hardcoded `1.9.0` version instead of the actual installed manifest version.

---

## [v2.0.7] — 2026-06-03

### Added
- Added a `DEBUG_LOGGING` environment variable to the relay server (defaulting to `"0"` / disabled) to prevent console spam from verbose connection (`CONN`), room activity (`ROOM`, `DEDUPE`), and `CORS` events under load. Critical logs like `SERVER`, `SECURITY`, `AUTH`, and `ERROR` remain enabled at all times.

---

## [v2.0.6] — 2026-06-03

### Performance & Security Hardening
- Optimized failed authentication attempts cache eviction algorithm to $O(1)$ by exploiting Javascript `Map` insertion-order properties. This completely removes the previous array copying and sorting bottleneck, neutralizing a potential main-thread blocking DoS vector under heavy brute-force password traffic.

---

## [v2.0.5] — 2026-06-03

### Security & Hardening
- Hardened extension room idle auto-leave detection to correctly recognize when the target tab's video heartbeat goes stale (e.g., after tab navigation or media closure).
- Exported cleaner graceful shutdown and lifecycle methods (`stopServerForTests`) from the relay server to prevent socket leaks and port-binding conflicts during verify checks.

### Added
- Added a validation step in `test-locales.js` to ensure the supported language list in `extension/i18n.js` is perfectly synchronized with the actual JSON translation files in the locales directory.
- Added a robust route verification test suite (`scripts/test-server-routes.mjs`) covering rate limit throttling, caching headers, and admin metrics access control.

---

## [v2.0.4] — 2026-06-03

### Security & Hardening
- Hardened relay health endpoints against simple flood traffic: `GET /` and `GET /health` are now limited to 10 requests per minute per client IP.
- Added lazy 60-second server-side caching for `GET /`, basic `/health`, and admin `/health` JSON responses to reduce repeated health-check work under noisy polling.
- Added stricter brute-force throttling for invalid admin metrics bearer attempts.
- Added startup warning for short `ADMIN_METRICS_TOKEN` values and documented that production Node ports must stay private behind Caddy or another trusted reverse proxy.
- Lowered the default maximum peers per room to 25.

### Added
- Optional privacy-preserving admin metrics on `/health` when `ADMIN_METRICS_TOKEN` is configured and a valid bearer token is supplied. Metrics are aggregate-only and exclude room IDs, peer IDs, usernames, IP addresses, media titles, passwords, and other user-level data.

### Changed
- Removed `bcryptjs`; temporary room passwords continue to use keyed SHA-256/HMAC hashing as documented.
- Public room discovery is now rate-limited server-side to one refresh every 10 seconds per socket, with the extension refresh button locked for 11 seconds.

### Fixed
- Improved Shadow DOM video detection so real embedded players are not hidden by smaller light-DOM preview or placeholder videos.
- Fixed join-button timeout cleanup after join status responses.

---

## [v2.0.2] — 2026-06-02

### Fixed
- Peer identity spoofing in relay server: client-supplied `peerId` could be used to impersonate other peers in PEER_STATUS events. Server now always stamps `peerId` with the authenticated sender's identity.
- Amazon domain detection: replaced broad `includes('amazon.')` substring check with boundary-safe regex that correctly matches all Amazon storefronts (`amazon.com`, `amazon.de`, `amazon.co.uk`, etc.) while rejecting lookalike domains.

---

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Video detection on Prime Video: `findVideo()` now scores all video elements by size, duration, and mute state instead of picking the first one. Fixes 0×0 placeholder being selected over the actual player.
- History entries in debug report showing `?` instead of action names.
- Prime Video status in compatibility matrix updated to reflect partial support.

### Added
- Multi-video overview table in Copy Debug Report when a page has more than one `<video>` element. Shows resolution, mute state, playback state, readyState, duration, and marks the currently targeted video.

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-06-01

### 🌍 Multi-Language Extension (Biggest Feature!)
- **6-Language UI**: The browser extension is now fully translated into **English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Russian**. Switch languages instantly in Settings without reload.
- **Real-Time i18n**: Every label, button, tooltip, toast notification, empty state, and onboarding guide updates dynamically when the language changes.

### New Features
- **Copy Debug Report (Markdown)**: The *Copy Logs* button in the Status tab now copies a fully formatted Markdown debug report — system info, connection status, video diagnostics, action history, and logs. One click, paste into a GitHub issue, all debugging data ready.
- **Platform Auto-Detection**: The Dev tab now identifies streaming platforms (YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Vimeo, Dailymotion) and displays the detected platform.
- **Enhanced Video Debug Info**: 20+ new fields in the Status tab including network state, buffered ranges, dimensions (with 0×0 warning), media error codes, shadow DOM status, seeking/ended/loop flags, volume, playback speed, and data attributes.
- **No-Video Diagnostic Mode**: When no video is found, the Status tab shows platform, page title, video count, shadow DOM presence, and MediaSession data to help troubleshoot.

### Changed
- **New TwoPointZero Branding**: Updated extension icons (16/32/48/96/128px).
- **Larger Popup Logo**: Extension popup icon increased to 48px.
- **Prime Video Unblocked**: Removed `amazon.` from the tab blacklist so Amazon/Prime Video tabs appear in the video selector.
- **Improved Debug Report**: Full User-Agent string for accurate browser identification, UTC timestamp, connection details including server URL and room info.
- **Smart Disconnect**: Improved disconnect handling when leaving rooms.
- **Human-Readable Room IDs**: Expanded word lists for friendlier room names.
- **Custom Server Support**: WEB_JOIN_REQUEST and join button for custom server invite flows.
- **Reconnection Strategy**: Custom server reconnection improvements.
- **Episode-Aware Sync**: Command sequencing with smarter episode transition detection and echo suppression for smoother series binges.
- **Sync Status Refinements**: YouTube and Twitch sync behavior improved.
- **No External Dependencies**: Extension remains dependency-free with no library overhead.

### Fixed
- Hardcoded strings, missing translation keys, and Service Worker notification race conditions.
