All notable changes to the KoalaSync browser extension and relay server.

---

## [v2.0.1] — 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Video detection on Prime Video: `findVideo()` now scores all video elements by size, duration, and mute state instead of picking the first one. Fixes 0×0 placeholder being selected over the actual player.
- History entries in debug report showing `?` instead of action names.
- Prime Video status in compatibility matrix updated to reflect partial support.

### Added
- Multi-video overview table in Copy Debug Report when a page has more than one `<video>` element. Shows resolution, mute state, playback state, readyState, duration, and marks the currently targeted video.

## [v2.0.0] — 2026-05-31

### 🌍 Multi-Language Extension (Biggest Feature!)
- **6-Language UI**: The browser extension is now fully translated into **English, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese (Brazilian), and Russian**. Switch languages instantly in Settings without reload.
- **Real-Time i18n**: Every label, button, tooltip, toast notification, empty state, and onboarding guide updates dynamically when the language changes.
- **6-Language Website**: Landing page, join page, legal pages, and the interactive extension mockup now available in all 6 languages with proper hreflang tags.

### New Features
- **Copy Debug Report**: The *Copy Logs* button in the Status tab now copies a fully formatted Markdown report containing system info, connection status, video debug data, action history, and logs — ready to paste into GitHub issues.
- **Platform Auto-Detection**: The Dev tab now identifies streaming platforms (YouTube, Netflix, Twitch, Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Vimeo, Dailymotion) and displays the detected platform.
- **Enhanced Video Debug Info**: 20+ new fields in the Status tab including network state, buffered ranges, dimensions (with 0×0 warning), media error codes, shadow DOM status, seeking/ended/loop flags, volume, playback speed, and data attributes.
- **No-Video Diagnostic Mode**: When no video is found, the Status tab shows platform, page title, video count, shadow DOM presence, and MediaSession data to help troubleshoot.

### Changed
- **New TwoPointZero Branding**: Updated extension icons (16/32/48/96/128px), website favicon (PNG 16×16 + 32×32), Apple touch icon (192×192), and web manifest icons.
- **Larger Logo Display**: Popup logo increased to 48px; website nav logo to 64px with improved vertical centering.
- **Higher Quality AVIF**: Build script AVIF quality raised from 70 to 80, speed improved from 6 to 4, and minimum file size threshold removed so all assets get AVIF variants.
- **Prime Video Unblocked**: Removed `amazon.` from the tab blacklist so Amazon/Prime Video tabs appear in the video selector.
- **Improved Browser Detection**: Debug report now includes the full User-Agent string for accurate browser identification.
