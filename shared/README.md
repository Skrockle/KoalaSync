# KoalaSync Shared Constants

This directory contains constants and protocol definitions used by both the extension and the server.

## Syncing with the Extension
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every time this directory is modified, you must run `node scripts/build-extension.js` to keep the extension's copy up to date.

Because Browser Extensions (Manifest V3) cannot load files outside their root directory, all files in this directory must be copied to `extension/shared/` whenever they are modified. The build script handles this automatically.

## Security & Versioning Constants
- `OFFICIAL_SERVER_TOKEN`: A 32-byte hex token required to connect to the official relay server.
- `APP_VERSION`: The current version of the extension. Automatically injected from the git tag during CI release builds.
- `OFFICIAL_SERVER_URL`: The default endpoint for the official KoalaSync relay.
