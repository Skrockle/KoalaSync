<p align="center"><i>KoalaSync is a lightweight Browser Extension and Relay Server for synchronized video playback on almost any website with a video element—YouTube, Twitch, Netflix, Emby, Jellyfin, and beyond. Built with a focus on <b>Data Sovereignty</b> and <b>Performance</b>.</i></p>

### 🌟 Why KoalaSync?

*   **🛡️ Security-First**: Volatile RAM-based relay with built-in brute-force protection and zero-persistence architecture.
*   **📡 Direct Logic**: Manual Socket.IO wire implementation for reliable synchronization.
*   **🛠️ Clean Build**: Dependency-free extension runtime with no library overhead.
*   **🌐 Universal**: Works on any website with a `<video>` tag.

### ✨ Key Features

- **Global Synchronization**: Synchronize Play, Pause, and Seeking on any website with a `<video>` tag.
- **Episode Auto-Sync**: Perfectly sync series binges. All peers wait until everyone has loaded the next episode before starting together.
- **Smart Matching**: Automatically highlights tabs containing matching video titles.
- **Dual Heartbeat Architecture**: Robust session tracking that prevents ghost rooms and stale connections.
- **Efficient Relay**: Minimal overhead WebSocket message forwarding.
- **Seamless Invitations**: Smart links that automatically configure server and room credentials for your friends.

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### For Users (Installation & Usage)
The easiest and safest way to install KoalaSync is directly through the official browser stores:

<p>
  <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/koalasync/obbnmkmlaaddodakcbdljknjpagklifc"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Chrome-Download-blue?logo=googlechrome&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" alt="Chrome Extension"></a>
  <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/koalasync/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Firefox-Download-orange?logo=firefoxbrowser&logoColor=white&style=for-the-badge" alt="Firefox Add-on"></a>
</p>

*(For manual offline installation: Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/Shik3i/KoalaSync/releases) page and load it as an "Unpacked Extension" in Developer Mode).*

**How to use:**
1. **Create a Room:** Click the Koala icon in your browser and hit `+ Create New Room`.
2. **Invite Friends:** Share the auto-copied invite link. Once they click it, they automatically join.
3. **Pick a Video:** Navigate to the Sync Tab, select the tab playing your video, and grab some popcorn! 🍿

### 🛠️ For Developers & Self-Hosters

#### 📂 Repository Structure

- `extension/`: Browser Extension (Chrome & Firefox).
- `server/`: Node.js + Socket.IO Relay Server (Containerized).
- `website/`: Marketing landing page & Invitation Bridge.
- `shared/`: **Single Source of Truth** for protocol constants.
- `scripts/`: Automated build and synchronization utilities.
- `docs/`: Technical deep-dives ([Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), [Sync Guide](docs/SYNC_GUIDE.md)).

#### Building from Source
To build the extension from source and synchronize protocol constants:
```bash
npm install
node scripts/build-extension.js
```
The compiled artifacts will be available in the `dist/` directory.

#### For Self-Hosting (Docker)
Deploy your own private relay server using our official image:
```bash
# Pull the latest image
docker pull ghcr.io/shik3i/koalasync:latest

# Or use our example compose file
cp docker-compose.caddy.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d
```
The server will be available at `ws://localhost:3000`. See [Docker network compose](docker-compose.caddy.example.yml) or [Static IP compose](docker-compose.ip.example.yml) for ready-to-use Docker Compose files.

To connect your extension to a self-hosted server, open the popup → **Room** tab → select **Custom Server** → enter your server's WebSocket URL (e.g., `ws://localhost:3000`).

> **⚠️ Note**: `ws://` only works for `localhost`. If you deploy to a real domain, you **must** use `wss://` (e.g., `wss://sync.yourdomain.com`). This requires a TLS-terminating reverse proxy (e.g., Caddy, Nginx, or Traefik) in front of the relay server. See [Caddyfile.example](Caddyfile.example) for a production-ready template.

To verify your relay is reachable from outside, visit `https://your-domain.com` in a browser — it should return `{"status":"online","service":"KoalaSync Relay"}`.
